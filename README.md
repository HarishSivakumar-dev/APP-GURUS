This project leverages blockchain and IPFS to build a secure, tamper-proof certificate issuance and verification system. Each certificate is uploaded to IPFS, which generates a unique hash based on its content. This hash is then stored on the blockchain using a smart contract, ensuring the certificate's authenticity and immutability. During verification, the uploaded certificate's hash is compared with the one stored on-chain. If they match, the certificate is confirmed as valid, providing a decentralized, transparent, and reliable way to issue and verify digital credentials.
